// My journey. And my history!

// My name is Paul Coroneos. I have been a professional front-end web developer since January of 2019. The journey up to this point was rather long. I hope you\'ll let me indulge a bit with my history getting to this point.
// In 2007 I decided to apply to be an electrical engineer in 2007. I spent 2007-2011 studying and graduated with BS in EE and Applied Mathematics. I landed my dream job at the time working at a little known company called Texas Instruments.

// My first 2 and a half years of my career I spent working as a process engineer in one of the oldest wafer fabrication sites in the company (DFAB). I worked with and extremely talented group of engineers and technicians cutting my teeth in the world of semiconductors.

// A common trend in my life is my inability to not be learning something at all times. Around 2012 I started my Masters in Electrical Engineering while working full time. Let me tell you this is not easy. I think I would rank it second to my bootcamp experience (more on this later) but it came darn close. I had thoughts of being an integrated circuit designer and focused heavily on circuit design. After a lot of late nights and hard work I managed to graduate in 2016

// During this time I started to realize programming was my passion. I applied for a few months trying to get a full time test engineering role and eventually accepted one supporting the DC/DC converter team with a now defunct group called Analog Engineering Operations.
// It was here that I finally was able to start coding in a C++ environment or more modern tools. I cut my teeth in somewhat modern coding using visual studio code 2005 and 2010 on tools such as the Eagle ETA364 and ETS88. I designed PCB\'s for testing semiconductors, did customer return analysis, performed qualifications, and even provided remote factory support for a variety of issues.

// To be continued!
